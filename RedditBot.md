# Reddit Bot

I made [u/FSRS_bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/FSRS_bot/) on Reddit, it helps people on [r/Anki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki) and [r/medicalschoolanki](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki) with FSRS-related questions.
In this article, I want to talk about all the different things I did to improve it. This isn't super educational and quite technical, though you will learn a thing or two about machine learning.
I won't be showing my entire code since it's too spaghetti, but I will show some code snippets.

## Where it all began - keyword matching
