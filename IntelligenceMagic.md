# Intelligence Is Not Magic, But Your Threshold For "Magic" Is Pretty Low

A while ago I saw a person arguing that a superintelligent AI would not be able to do anything too weird and that "intelligence is not magic", hence it's Business As Usual.

Of course, in a purely technical sense, he's right. No matter how intelligent you are, you cannot override fundamental laws of physics. But people (myself included) have a fairly low threshold for what counts as "magic," to the point where other humans can surpass that threshold.

Example 1: Trevor Rainbolt. There is an [8-minute-long video](https://youtu.be/QRqKPDJYyLE) where he does seemingly impossible things, such as correctly guessing that a photo of **nothing but literal blue sky** was taken in Indonesia or guessing Jordan based only on pavement. He can also [correctly identify the country after looking at a photo for **0.1** seconds](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eAppbmqlnuw).

Example 2: [Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_%22El_Chapo%22_Guzm%C3%A1n). He ran a drug empire **while being imprisoned**. Tell this to anyone who still believes that "boxing" a superintelligent AI is a good idea.

Example 3: [Stephen Wiltshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wiltshire). He made a nineteen-foot-long drawing of New York City after flying on a helicopter for 20 minutes, and he got the number of windows and floors of all the buildings correct.

Example 4: Magnus Carlsen. Being good at chess is one thing. Being able to [play 3 games against 3 people **while blindfolded**](https://youtu.be/xmXwdoRG43U) is a different thing. And he also did it [with 10 people](https://youtu.be/cTeDkyQUbyY). He can also[memorize the positions of all pieces on the board in 2 seconds](https://youtu.be/FNEWS7Ny73w?t=434) (to be fair, the pieces weren't arranged randomly, it was a snapshot from a famous game).

Example 5: Chris Voss, an FBI negotiator. This is a much less well-known example, I learned it from o3, actually. Chris Voss has [convinced two armed bank robbers](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/chris-voss-teaches-the-art-of-negotiation/chapters/case-study-chase-manhattan-bank-robbery) [to surrender](https://greghague.com/fbi-hostage-negotiator-outsmarts-armed-robbers/) (this isn't the only example in his career, of course) **while only using a phone**, no face-to-face interactions, so no opportunities to read facial expressions. Imagine that you have to convince two dudes with guns who are about to get homicidal to just...chill. Using only a phone. And you succeed.
So if you think, "Pfft, what, AI will convince me to go from hostile to cooperative within minutes, after a little chit-chat?" well, yes, it just might.

Examples 2 and 5 are especially relevant in the context of controlling AI. So if you are surprised by these examples, you will be even more surprised by what a superintelligent AI can do.

Intelligence is not magic. But if even "natural" intelligence can get you this far, imagine what an AGI can do.
