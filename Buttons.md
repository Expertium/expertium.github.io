# Button usage and review time of Anki users

Apart from being great for benchmarking algorithms on it, the [Anki 20k dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-spaced-repetition/FSRS-Anki-20k) also provides a definitive answer to an age-old question: is the amount of time spent reviewing a card correlated with which answer button (Again/Hard/Good/Easy) the user will press?

Here's the answer: 

![Review time](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0b9fa96-d23f-471a-930c-cb3311f30921)

This is based on 20k collections and 1.4 **billion** reviews. The black caps are 99% confidence intervals, but they are too narrow to see properly.

I also analyzed how often the following inequality (and others) holds true: average_t(Again) > average_t(Hard) > average_t(Good) > average_t(Easy).

Here's a stacked bar chart aka [pie chart's cooler brother](https://github.com/cxli233/FriendsDontLetFriends?tab=readme-ov-file#10-friends-dont-let-friends-make-pie-chart):

In case you are confused: for example, Again > Hard > Good > Easy means "Average time for 'Again' is greater than the average time for 'Hard', which in turn is greater than the average time for 'Good', which in turn is greater than the average time for 'Easy'". But that's too long, so I just wrote it as Again > Hard > Good > Easy.

I hope nobody will interpret this article as "It's ok to use review time to automatically select the answer button for the user".

1) Time to answer varies not only between different people but also between different types of material. So Anki will have to estimate what time corresponds to Again-Hard-Good-Easy for this specific user and for this specific material.
   
2) average_t(Again) > average_t(Hard) > average_t(Good) > average_t(Easy) is true only for 40% of users.

3) There will be outliers if the user went to the toilet or got distracted by a phone call or something.

It's **WAY** easier to just use self-reported grades. There are a lot of arguments about using 2 vs 4 buttons, and those arguments will likely last as long as Anki itself, but using time as a proxy for the answer button will be worse than either of those options. Using time as a proxy will work reliably only for about 40% of users, will be prone to outliers, and the exact cutoffs will have to be adjusted for each user individually and for different decks.

Compare that to just asking the user to click a button.
