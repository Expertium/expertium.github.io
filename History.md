# Abridged history of spaced repetition

1885: [Hermann Ebbinghaus plots the first forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve). Although it didn't have retention on the Y axis, and also, if you have ever seen one of the images below (or something similar), you should know that **his paper didn't have that serrated kind of curve. That is a common myth.**

1885-1972: nothing. Some researcher occasionally publishes a paper about the spacing effect, which nobody cares about. I wouldn't even be surprised if multiple researchers re-discovered the spacing effect independently.

1972: [Sebastian Leitner invents the Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system). As crude as it is, it's the first spaced repetition system that looks like what spaced repetition looks like today. [Learning steps](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#learning-steps) in Anki are essentially that.

1985: [SM-0](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/The_birthday_of_spaced_repetition:_July_31,_1985) is developed. It wasn't a computer algorithm, and was done purely with paper notes.

1987: [SM-2](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) is developed, it is still used in Anki and other apps, like Mnemosyne.

1987-2010s: not much. Piotr Wozniak develops [SM-5](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/First_fast-converging_spaced_repetition_algorithm:_Algorithm_SM-5), SM-whatever, but they are proprietary, so this has little to no impact on spaced repetition research and other apps.

2010s: Duolingo develops [HLR](https://github.com/duolingo/halflife-regression/blob/master/settles.acl16.pdf). Some other models, like [ACT-R](http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/themes/ACT-R/workshops/2003/proceedings/46.pdf) and DASH are developed by other people, but nobody gives a damn. To the best of my knowledge, neither ACT-R nor any of the [DASH](https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/zp38wc97m) [variants](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/retrieve/b39227dd-0963-40f2-a44b-624f205cb224/2022_4_Randazzo_01.pdf) have ever been used outside of a scientific paper. Woz develops [SM-17](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-17) and SM-18, they are also proprietary. However, he does describe key concepts and ideas on [supermemo.guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru), which was important for developing FSRS.

2022: FSRS v3 is developed. This was the first publicly available version that people actually used. FSRS v1 and v2 weren't publicly available.

2023: For the first time since the development of SM-2, app developers start implementing a new algo - FSRS, with Anki being the pioneer. Though it's possible that some obscure app has experimented with machine learning (excluding Duolingo, I have already mentioned them) and I am simply unaware of that.

2024: [RemNote implements FSRS-4.5](https://help.remnote.com/en/articles/9124137-the-fsrs-spaced-repetition-algorithm) (or FSRS v4? I'm not sure), [some chess moves learning app](https://x.com/chessbookcom/status/1805137108991946775) apparently does too.
