# New note types

## Match Pairs

Have you ever had cards like this? There are 2 pieces of knowledge and you can't remember which is which, so you make a Cloze.

But there is a problem - you may end up just memorizing "thingy 1 is the top one, thingy 2 is the bottom one". In order to avoid that, you could make two notes with the order switched.

However, this is inefficient - now you have 2 notes for the same thing. If only there was a way to put them into the same note and randomize order...

And it's not the only advantage of this note type. It also supports images.

And audio.

(video 3, 雪 vs 勇気)

And if you think that this is too easy, and therefore would make active recall ineffective, you can make your life harder by adding 1 or 2 fake answers.

![3 capitals](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4133a134-4501-4a7b-a17b-a562d0ec3228)

Here you have 2 countries but 3 capitals, so you can't answer correctly if you only know the capital of one country but not the capital of the other one. <br />
Make sure that the extra answer is wrong, but not *obviously* wrong. In this example, I won't benefit from adding Jakarta to the second list, since it's obviously wrong. Which is why I added Amsterdam. I don't have to think very hard to remember that Jakarta is neither the capital of Sweden nor Switzerland, whereas Amsterdam makes me pause and think.

Of course, how useful this note type is for you depends on how often you encounter what I call "negative interference", where card A makes it harder to remember card B, and card B makes it harder to remember card A. Personally, I really wish that this note type would become a built-in type. I think it has enough advantages to justify being a part of Anki.

## Randomized Cloze

This is another note type that aims to solve the "memorizing the shape of the question rather than the content" problem.

## Alternative

There is another note type conceptually similar to Match Pairs: https://github.com/cjdduarte/anki-template-interactive-drag-drop/blob/main/Example.apkg. Feel free to use whichever you like more.
