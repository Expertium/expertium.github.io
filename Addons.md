## FSRS Helper

It's not essential if you want to use FSRS, but it offers a lot of nice quality-of-life features. [I have an entire post dedicated to them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1attbo1/explaining_fsrs_helper_addon_features/).

## Review Heatmap

It is the highest rated add-on on AnkiWeb, so while I doubt that it needs an introduction, I just thought the list wouldn't be complete without it.

Do you want to customize your answer buttons? Do you want to change their colors? Make them wider? Or change the font size? Hide Hard? Hide Easy? Add new shortcuts? Rename "Again" to "Fail"? You can do all of that and more with this add-on.

Btw, here's what my buttons look like:

## Simple Forvo Audio Downloader

It is indispensable for language learners. It allows you to select a word and find an audio file with a native speaker pronouncing that word. It's simple to use, and it's better than TTS...unless the word is really obscure and there is no audio.
Still, this has been very helpful in my language studies, and it's my personal favorite on this list.

## Randomize Fonts

This one might raise some eyebrows, but I think it's very useful for Japanese (or Chinese). It forces you to recognize kanji in different fonts, including highly stylized ones.
