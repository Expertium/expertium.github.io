I write articles about spaced repetition, mostly about [FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/ABC-of-FSRS). That's all, end of the intro. Here are the articles, in no particular order:

1. (unfinished)[Benchmark of spaced repetition algorithms](https://github.com/Expertium/Expertium/blob/main/Benchmark.md). In this article, I analyze results from the [open spaced repetition benchmark repository](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/srs-benchmark?tab=readme-ov-file#result), where many modern spaced repetition algorithms are compared based on their ability to predict the probability of recall.
2. [Abridged history of spaced repetition](https://github.com/Expertium/Expertium/blob/main/History.md).
3. [A technical explanation of FSRS](https://github.com/Expertium/Expertium/blob/main/Algorithm.md), where I explain the formulas that are used to calculate the probability of recall.
